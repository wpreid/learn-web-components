    <p>Consider the greatest programmer you've ever known or read about. Was he or she brilliant? Artistic?
        Innovative? Determined? How sensitive was their nose?
    </p>

    <p>Huh?</p>

    <p>Yes, how well could they sniff out poor designs in code?</p>

            Well, that wasn't so bad once we understood slots, right?

    <p>It certainly helped, pedant!</p>


    <p>True enough, skeptic, but the first item is a good thing.</p>
    <p>The second item? that's pretty reasonable. Hmmm... it screws with the bubble tail!</p>
    <p>I don't know if components can reference outside styles. Let's learn!</p>

    <p>We are big fans of OAOO, DRY, SPOT, etc.</p>

    <p>There is plenty more where that came from!  We have invented a lot of different ways to say
    not to repeat ourselves. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>OAOO</em> Once And Only Once</li>
        <li><em>SPOT</em> Single Point of Truth (my favorite)</li>
        <li><em>DRY</em> Don't Repeat Yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How weird that we came up with three different ways to say that you shouldn't have
    different ways to say the same thing?</p>
