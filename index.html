    <!--        component: Callout (or just style?)-->
    <p class="callout-center">Code Smells document wisdom about how <i class="italic">not</i> to design software!

    <p>Consider the greatest programmer you've ever known or read about. Was he or she brilliant? Artistic?
        Innovative? Determined? How sensitive was their nose?
    </p>

    <p>Huh?</p>

    <p>Yes, how well could they sniff out poor designs in code?</p>

           <p>I have questions, though:</p>

                <li>Why does this resize based on text?</li>
                <li>what if the text gets really long and takes up a lot of space?</li>
                <li>Is there a way to NOT have the style in the component?</li>
                <li>why do we get the same face regardless of what we ask for?</li>
