    <p>Consider the greatest programmer you've ever known or read about. Was he or she brilliant? Artistic?
        Innovative? Determined? How sensitive was their nose?
    </p>

    <p>Huh?</p>

    <p>Yes, how well could they sniff out poor designs in code?</p>

    <p>It certainly helped, pedant!</p>


    <p>True enough, skeptic, but the first item is a good thing.</p>
    <p>The second item? that's pretty reasonable. Hmmm... it screws with the bubble tail!</p>
    <p>I don't know if components can reference outside styles. Let's learn!</p>

    </gh-image-quote>

    <p>We are big fans of OAOO, DRY, SPOT, etc.</p>

    <p>There is plenty more where that came from!  We have invented a lot of different ways to say
    not to repeat ourselves. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>OAOO</em> Once And Only Once</li>
        <li><em>SPOT</em> Single Point of Truth (my favorite)</li>
        <li><em>DRY</em> Don't Repeat Yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How weird that we came up with three different ways to say that you shouldn't have
    different ways to say the same thing?</p>

<h1 class="pageTitle">Long Method</h1>
<gh-right-image image="/images/big_burger.gif">
    <div slot="left-hand-text">
      <h2 class="callout-center">Like a very larger burger, a long method is too much to digest.</h2>
      <p>How long must a method be to exhibit the <code>Long Method</code> smell? If one cannot quickly
      and easily understand what a method does and how the method does it, it is a long method.</p>
        <p>Shorter methods provide these benefits:
        <ul>
        <li><em>Readable Code</em> - Shorter methods are easier to read and comprehend.</li>
        <li><em>Shared Code</em> - Shorter methods provide greater opportunity for fine-grained code sharing.</li>
        <li><em>Easier Testing</em> - Shorter method tend to be easier to microtest (AKA unit test).</li>
        <li><em>Safer Editing</em> - Shorter methods have fewer variables and states to manage.</li>
    </ul></p>
    </div>
</gh-right-image>

<p>We suggest that people not make methods long, dense, wide, or in any other way inconvenient
    for their friends to work with. Everyone is in a hurry so don't force them to be ultra-careful.</p>
