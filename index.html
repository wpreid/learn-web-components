    <p>Consider the greatest programmer you've ever known or read about. Was he or she brilliant? Artistic?
        Innovative? Determined? How sensitive was their nose?
    </p>

    <p>Huh?</p>

    <p>Yes, how well could they sniff out poor designs in code?</p>

            Here is the thing the <em>wiseass</em> is saying!

    <p>Yes, indeed, wiseass! And the thing you are saying is an amazing use of SLOTS!!</p>

            Well, that wasn't so bad once we understood slots, right?

    <p>It certainly helped, pedant!</p>

           <p>I have questions, though:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why does this resize based on text?</li>
                <li>what if the text gets really long and takes up a lot of space?</li>
                <li>Is there a way to NOT have the style in the component?</li>
                <li>why do we get the same face regardless of what we ask for?</li>
                <li>Did you see what happens to the bubble's tail?!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </gh-persona>

    <p>True enough, skeptic, but the first item is a good thing.</p>
    <p>The second item? that's pretty reasonable. Hmmm... it screws with the bubble tail!</p>
    <p>I don't know if components can reference outside styles. Let's learn!</p>
    <p>We don't -- We have already fixed that!</p>
    <p>Yes, and we'll work on that. The problem is that the locations are specified in percentages of
        the height of the view area, and longer windows have a greater distance between percentage
        points.</p>
